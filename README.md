Scrapper for products amazon


That's one of Amazons' many bot protection features.

Some of the things you could do:

Scrape slower.
Introduce some randomness.
Use a common, modern User-Agent.
Use multiple IPs.

- If you won't b/c scraping data from Amazon is against their TOS. So instead you are going to use the Amazon Product Advertising API ;)
