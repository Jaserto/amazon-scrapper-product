# Scrapper for products amazon

*Made by Jaserto*

Steps to follow.

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies with npm.
3. Go to the products file. Include the products you want to scrape.
4. Finally, run it with npm run start or node index.js.

That's one of Amazons' many bot protection features.

Some of the things you could do:

Scrape slower.
Introduce some randomness.
Use a common, modern User-Agent.
Use multiple IPs.

- If you won't b/c scraping data from Amazon is against their TOS. So instead you are going to use the Amazon Product Advertising API ;)
